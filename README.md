A quick tool for doing things with *Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance* binary `.scmap` map files.

Made with LÖVE https://github.com/love2d/love. Requires LÖVE 12 so that `data:getString` can take offset values.


Drop an scmap file into the window, and it'll unpack its contents, and display the heightmap and where units can't path. (Mostly)
