A quick tool for doing things with *Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance* binary `.scmap` map files.
Made with LÖVE https://github.com/love2d/love. Requires LÖVE 12 so that `data:getString` can take offset values.
Implemented features include extracting the raw heightmap, and rendering the heightmap and the path blocking assuming default values.
